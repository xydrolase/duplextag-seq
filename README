This directory hosts a series of tools to process the reads generated by 
Duplex Tag Sequencing technique developed by Schmitt et al. (2013), titled

__Detection of ultra-rare mutations by next-generation sequencing__

See the supplementary document of above paper for more details about the 
data processing pipeline.

### tagfilter

The first stage in the data analysis: filtering by fixed sequence and tag
complexity.

### tagcluster

Perform read clustering by tags, and then pair collapsed SSCSs into pairs.
